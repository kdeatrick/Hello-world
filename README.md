*Command Line and gitHUB*

* #Command Line [codecadamy](http://codecademy.com)
  Command line is a useful language to quickly interface with a computer using lines of code rather than directly interacing with the GUI
  Command line is very useful to more advanced users as it is generally more powerful in terms of manipulating and directing a computer. 
  For example, recently I was in the library with a wired data connection, however cell and wifi signal was poor so I wanted to turn my 
  computer into a hotspot that would relay the data connection into a wifi signal for my phone to use. 
  
    In command terminal I simple directed the computer to: 1)netsh wlan set hostednetwork mode=allow ssid=Skynet key=s11ss11s
                                                           2)netsh wlan start hostednetwork
    This command instanly started broadcasting my wired connection through wifi for my cell phone to recieve. Very useful and somethign not     available through the computer GUI
    
* #gitHUB ![GitHub Logo](/images/logo.png) [gitHUB](http://github.com)
    GitHUB is an exeptional organization tool generaly used as a hub for teams of individuals programming software, however the uses are       endless, and I can see it being a very useful organizational tool for graduate students who are writing.
